Hi

Please see [videos & code samples](https://glukit.com/consulting/) of client-work,   
[demos & repos](https://grajeda.com/portfolio/) from my portfolio or a mini [resume](https://grajeda.com/other/redirect-to-resume.html).

All work is being migrated to [GluKit](https://glukit.com/consulting/).  
Thanks for reading!

PS   
Most of my code is in *private* repos ; on/off GitHub.  
The above is what I can (legally) make public.
