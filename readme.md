# Readme

Hi

Most of my code is in private repos ; on/off GitHub.

My current side project is [RemoList](https://remolist.com) ; the tech details are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13n46E8k5GjLLkJgEWlzOVheHdxtO9GWghSwP4yM6kT0/). 

If you are logged into GitHub, you should be able to see my [public repos](https://github.com/ottograjeda?tab=repositories).   
If not, you can see my portfolio [here](https://grajeda.com/portfolio/) or click [here](https://gist.github.com/ottograjeda/) to see my public gists.
