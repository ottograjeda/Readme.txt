# Readme

Hi

Please see [videos & code samples](https://glukit.com/consulting/) of client-work   
or these [demos & repos](https://grajeda.com/portfolio/) from my portfolio.

All work is being migrated to [GLUKIT](https://glukit.com/consulting/).  
Thanks for reading!

PS   
Most of my code is in *private* repos ; on/off GitHub.  
The above is what I can (legally) make public.
